## Purpose 
This repository contains all the material and coursework of the [Applied Econometrics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/abroad/module-options/module?id=89d364aa-a1f7-4096-b4cf-605bdff23788) course I took in KingÂ´s College London (2019/2020).  The course covers the key statistical methods that economists use to disentangle cause and effect: regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, and difference-in-differences. These methods are illustrated with interesting and relevant real-world examples. The coursework contains all the problem sets and the final project with their corresponding data and Stata scripts.
<br>

I will also add material to this repo on causal inference and experimental design. As I believe knowledge on causal inference will soon become an indispensable skill for data scientists.
